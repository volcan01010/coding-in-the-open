Digital Strategy

Collaborative, open and reproducible research 
process

To make the research process more collaborative, 
open and reproducible, we will develop digital 
science laboratories that are accessible to both 
BGS scientists and their collaborators. This virtual 
space will provide a place to experiment with 
new technologies and find new ways to use the 
information and data that we provide.
